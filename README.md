I would like to be part of the robotics programming sub team for a couple of reasons. The first would be that I enjoy coding and would like the opportunity to do more of it. After being a part time member last year and kind of watching what each sub team does I feel that programming would be the most fun, most challenging, and most impactful place for me. I also know that you (Kiddy & Steve) are very good at programming and would like to better myself by working with you. I feel like I would be able to contribute to the programming team as well as learning to become a better programmer personally.
